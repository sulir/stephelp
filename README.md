StepHelp
========

StepHelp is a site where registered users can put information about projects they can not accomplish alone. Each project consists of:

* tasks which the owner can handle
* tasks which need help of an another person

Other users can support the project not by giving the money, but by actually helping - buying and sending a thing, creating some icons, etc.
